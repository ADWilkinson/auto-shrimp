# AutoShrimp

Want total automated control over your Exchange portfolio? **AutoShrimp** allows your portfolios to be selected and rebalanced based on TradingView webhook alerts. Whether you want to convert all to a stablecoin because you predict markets will drop, or you think alt season is upon us and want to quickly accumulate BTC value. All this can be triggered by your chart analysis whilst not having to worry about logging in and reacting in time.

## Prerequisite

To use AutoShrimp, there are a few dead simple steps to follow. 

1. [Shrimpy](https://shrimpy.io/referral?r=sA7mSLRan) subscription
2. Link your target exchange to Shrimpy, we highly recommend [Binance](https://www.binance.com/en/register?ref=17017553)
3. Create a set portfolios as normal that you want to switch to via TradingView alerts e.g. 100% Altcoins, 100% BTC, 100% Stablecoins, or a balanced portfolio across different coins.
4. Any [TradingView](https://tradingview.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=2&aff_id=11772) subscription 
5. First create an API key on your Shrimpy account page.
6. Take record of your *public* and *secret* key that are generated for you

AutoShrimp is a node express based weberver that needs to run 24/7 to be able to recieve your alerts and react to it. Therefore it is advised to run this either on a small machine like ethernet connected Raspberry Pi at home or ideally a cheap cloud VPS.
